              Iâ€™m a qualified vinyasa and yin teacher who loves surprising her
              students with creative transitions and introducing them to new
              poses. My classes are challenging, yet inclusive, as I aim to
              create a space where you can feel supported as you explore the
              limits of your practice and take small steps outside of your
              comfort zone.

good that you offered room for more challenging poses which I loved as a more
experienced yogi. Felt very calm and blessed after."

challenging but also comfortable and at no point did I feel under pressure to do certain
moves which I've found in other sessions before.

energised. I felt challenged and was able to push myself a little more with each practice if
that's what I wanted to do and was always given options to help me get what I want out of
the session
